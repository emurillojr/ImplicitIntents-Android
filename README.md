# ImplicitIntents-Android
Implicit Intents <br>
Create an activity that has buttons to do the following <br>
List all contacts <br>
Captures an image <br>
Shows a location on Google Maps <br>
Note: You will need to create an emulator in Android Studio that has Google API’s and a camera. <br>
If you get a “kernel file not found error” and/or ANDROID_SDK_ROOT undefined.  There seems to be a bug in creating the <br>
Google API emulators, the kernel file is not being created.  So, this seems to work. <br>
•	Go to where your SDK is installed, go to system images and the api level and CPU that you are using; <br>
•	Copy the kernel.qemu file. <br>
•	Go to the add-ons directory in the sdk, go to the desired API sub folder and then the CPU subfolder, paste the kernel.qemu file there. <br>
